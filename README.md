# Timely-Tweeter
My first repository project

##Features



 *Posts to Twitter from the command line
 *Makes a post after set time amount
 *Reads posts from a file

##Quick Start

First create an app using the Twitter Developer service
Then get the different keys you need from the Twitter API
         *Consumer Key (API Key)
         *Consumer Secret (API Secret)
         *Access Token
         *Access Token Secret
Be sure to set the access level of the app to "Read and Write"
Then update Timely_Tweeter.py with the different keys and tokens you found.
You can also set the amount of time in between tweets, which is in seconds.
In order for the program to have something to tweet,you will need to create     a text file with different tweets you wish to make on each line.

To execute Timely Tweeter in linux, type:
         python Timely_Tweeter.py list_filename.txt
 
This should run the program, and start making tweets to the Twitter account     used to retrieve the keys and tokens.
